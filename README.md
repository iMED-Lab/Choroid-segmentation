An overview of the proposed boundary enhancement framework for choroid segmentation. A
novel BEM is incorporated into each encoder/decoder layer of the proposed framework. In addition, a
pre-trained VGG network is utilized to calculate the specific boundary perceptual loss to improve the
choroidal boundary segmentation with the guidance of the soft point map generated from ground truth.
